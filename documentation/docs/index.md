Welcome to the Genially Plugin Alpha documentation!

Keep in mind this feature is in a very early alpha state, we are gathering feedback and making sure that everything works as intended.

The documentation, too, is in a very early and alpha state. This wiki has some scattered information to help you build your plugins.

The [Examples](Examples.html) page where we have some code samples with common uses of the API that you might find useful

The [Reference](reference/modules) page contains more formal documentation of several aspects of the API.

We also have an [F.A.Q](FAQ.html) (Frequently Asked Questions) that might come in handy.
